### A Video Analysis Framework Based on Gstreamer
- In this framework, components are built during the decoding process and connected via Gstreamer's Pipeline element, activated by the BUS element. Post-decoding, 
- OpenCV reads the results.
- The analysis algorithm then utilizes OpenCV to process frames, annotating them with rectangles and object types.
