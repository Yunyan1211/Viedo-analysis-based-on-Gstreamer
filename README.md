### A Video Analysis Framework Based on Gstreamer
-In this framework, components are built during the decoding process and connected via Gstreamer's Pipeline element, activated by the BUS element. Post-decoding, 
-OpenCV reads the results. The analysis algorithm then utilizes OpenCV to process frames, annotating them with rectangles and object types. 
-This framework facilitates the broader use of video analysis technology across various industries and regions.
